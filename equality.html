                        <li>In Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973), the Supreme Court upheld the importance of equality as part of the Constitution’s basic structure.</li>
                        <li>No individual, including government officials or politicians, can claim immunity from the law. For example, leaders have been tried and convicted for corruption under this principle.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Prohibition of Discrimination:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Educational institutions cannot deny admission based on caste, religion, or gender. For instance, reserving seats for specific religions while excluding others violates this right.</li>
                        <li>Landmark case: State of Madras v. Champakam Dorairajan (1951) declared caste-based admissions quotas unconstitutional, leading to the first amendment of the Indian Constitution.</li>

                        <li>Any biased or unfair selection process can be challenged under this right.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Abolition of Untouchability:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The practice of untouchability, a deep-rooted societal evil, is punishable under the Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955.</li>
                        <li>Example: Cases where Dalits were denied access to public places like temples or water sources have been resolved under this law.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Abolition of Titles:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Titles such as “Sir” or “Knight,” which were once used in colonial times to signify privilege, are abolished in independent India.</li>
                        <li>Exceptions are titles related to academics (like Dr.) or military ranks.</li>
                    </ul>
